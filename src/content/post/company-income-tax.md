Being accredited by the Singapore Institute of Accredited Tax Practitioner, we assist in preparation and submission of the Annual Tax Return (Form C, tax computation) and Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI).
Taxation is required to meet the following statutory filing deadlines set by Government:
Filing of Estimated Chargeable Income (ECI): within 3 months from the financial year end of your company.
Filing of annual tax return (Form C, tax computation and financial statements): by 30 November each year.
Singapore’s corporate tax rate is 17%. The effective tax rate is in fact lower due to partial exemptions available to all companies and even more favorable exemptions available to new companies. With its extensive double tax treaty network and absence of capital gains coupled with exemptions, these benefits have definitely made Singapore the most attractive location for companies to set up.
