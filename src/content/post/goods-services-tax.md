The Singapore Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a tax charged on the supply of goods and services made in Singapore and on the importation of goods into Singapore. The current rate for GST is 7%.
Your business must be registered to collect GST if your annual turnover exceeds or is likely to exceed S$1 million from the sale of taxable goods and services. This requirement may be waived if most of your goods or services are exported or supplied internationally (zero-rated supplies).
All goods and services are taxable and known as taxable supplies. However, some items are specifically exempt from GST by law. Exempted items include financial services and the sale or lease of residential properties.
